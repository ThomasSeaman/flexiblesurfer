                    Cat and cow is a traditional way to start any yoga class but I like to use it to start my day. It is essential for back and
                    neck health as it allows your spine to warm up one vertebrae at a time. On the inhale, arch your back
                    and look up and on exhale release your head and pull your belly button up. I like to work towards a longer
                    breath through 10 breathing cycles (20 movements)

                    Once my spine is warmed up I like to move onto the back wedge. The positions of the wedge can range from lower to mid back
                    in order to relieve tension in a problem area.

                <p>
                    This excise is similar to cat and cow but will be moving the head to the left and the hip to the right in a slithering snake
                    motion. This allows our vertebrae to warm up in a different direction and gets out ab and hip muscles
                    firing.

                <p>
                    from there you build on the snake motion, dipping the hips and warming up the IT bands. Tight ID bands can plaque surfers
                    with lower back pain, outer knee pain, and a decrease in range of motion leading to injuries like pulled
                    hamstrings and a higher likelihood of torn knee tendons.

                    Now that our back is warmed up we can begin to stretch deeper. This exercise will get your hamstring firing and is another
                    deeper spine warm up. When you drop your hips, try to come down in a controlled manner once vertebrae
                    at a time. At the top of the stroke try to come onto your shoulder blades and hold for 2 to 3 seconds.

                    Now that we have began to stress the spine vertically we can begin to stress is laterally. Start with slow swing and straight
                    arms and move towards loose arms and more momentum in your swing.

                    now we can move on to stretch the lower back. We begin with simple knee to chest pulls while lying on the yoga mat. While
                    this seems like a leg and hip stretch, it is opening up our lower back for a deeper stretch.

                    figure for is my favorite stretch for where my hips meet my lower back. I often am tight in these places from long surf sessions
                    with a lot of paddling. Keeping my head raise for hours can cause train to the arch of my lower back.

                    spin to the side for a weight twist, the leg looped over the other serves as extra leverage to drive the lower back to rotate
                    over itself. Find a limit and breath into it. On each exhale you can pull small increments into the stretch
                    but donâ€™t over do it. hard twisting motions have proven to be bad for the back unless properly progressed
                    and warmed up.

                    Now that we are warmed up and stretched out. It is important to work out knots and strains throughout the back. Using a lacrosse
                    ball is my favorite spot to start because they are cheap and serve as a great tool to roll on or against.
                    I keep one in my gym bag, car, living room and at my desk at the office. Even putting the ball between
                    your back and a chair can serve as a relief from a tight back after a long surf. I buy them in bulk because
                    I played lacrosse in college but they can be found in single, three and twelve packs on amazon. They
                    are made of solid rubber and last forever.

                <p>
                    Now that we located some of our larger knots with the lacrosse ball. The theracane is an amazing tool to pinpoint and applying
                    more leverage to stubborn back knots. I like to start on one side and move through my back then move
                    to the other side. The theracane is a hard item to demo on but basically you just find you leverage points
                    to dig deep into back knots, regardless of how awkward you may look the theracane feels really good.
                    I keep one at the office and one at home.
